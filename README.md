# Music-Search
Still in the works

## Project Description

This project will be able to have a user search up an artist and see their top tracks and albums.

## API and Data Sample

Specify the API you are using and include a link. Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.



#### MVP 
-Ceate a search button and make it interactable 
- Create a title for the webpage
- Have the artist pop up with a picture, their top 5 albums and songs with pictures along side them 
- center it all and make it look neat
- put numbers to the albums and tracks according to their ranks
- add some photos for the background of the website 
- 

#### PostMVP  
- Add second API that connects to the link for the songs or plays a sample
- Add some animations for when it loads the tracks or make a slideshow for the user to go through
- give an option for recommended artist based upon their selection
